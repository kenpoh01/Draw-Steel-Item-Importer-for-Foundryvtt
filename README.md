TO INSTALL: Drop the draw-steel-item-importer folder into your modules folder before launching FoundryVTT. After launching the software, in should appear under the "Add-on modules" tab. Launch your draw-steel world. Then, activate the module under "Game Settings" and "Manage Modules".



When you go to the "Create Item" tab, there should be an "Import Draw Steel Item" button at the bottom of the panel. Click it and follow the instructions. Copy and paste the associate blocks from the Heroes pdf.



More functionality will be coming in the future, at the moment (see "not yet implemented" next to some choices)

PLEASE NOTE: There are some limitations to how well the parser is able to differentiate splits between entries.  This is especially true with the leveled treasures at the moment.  You may need to either import some individually once you see which ones don't work well, deleting the wrongly created files.  You may also need to manually input some of the Details fields.
